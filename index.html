        <p class="story">   Could Chucks is a business run by successful tweentrepreneurs Tina, Louise, Jean, and our extras in our class. 
            We first started out with plenty of heart selling Wood Chucks before we went down a dark path led mostly by Tina. During this dark
            path we lost ourselves in the pursuit of profits and made an inferior product called Wood Chuck 2. After we nearly went bankrupt following the release
            of Wood Chucks 2 we went back to our roots and released Could Chucks, cause they could be anything! </p>
